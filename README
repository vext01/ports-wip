Edd Barrett's Ports-WIP Git Repo
--------------------------------

When I am working on ports, they end up here as a directory suitible for use
with /usr/ports/mystuff. You will need to set in mk.conf:
PORTSDIR_PATH=${PORTSDIR}/mystuff:${PORTSDIR}

The technique is quite meta in that I import the CVS/ directories right into
git. This makes working with cvs over multiple machines less painful. Once
things are commited upstream, I remove them from git so that they don't take
priority over the main tree anymore.
