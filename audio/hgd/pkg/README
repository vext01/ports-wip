Running a Server
====================

All commands shown here are run as root.

* Create the SQLite Database

The database is created under /var/hgd and needs to be owned by the _hgd user:

  ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/hgd-admin db-init && chown _hgd /var/hgd/*

* Add Users

For each user you would run:

  ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/hgd-admin user-add <username>

Users can be promoted to admins:

  ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/hgd-admin user-mkadmin <username>

* Start Daemons

Start hgd_netd and hgd_playd using the standard rc.d procedures:

  ${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.d/hgd_netd && ${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.d/hgd_playd

Check everything went OK:

  ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/hgd-admin status

Using the HGD Client
====================

  hgdc -u <username> q <some_media_file>

Misecllaneous Notes
===================

* Both the client and server are configurable using a config file. See the
  example config files and manual pages for details.

* If you use aucat, remember that the _hgd user must have access to the aucat
  socket.
