| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Running a Server
================

All commands shown here are run as root.

Prepare the Server
------------------

First you should create the SQLite database (which needs to be owned by
the _hgd user):
  ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/hgd-admin db-init && chown _hgd /var/hgd/*

Next you should add users. For each user you would run:
  ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/hgd-admin user-add <username>

Users can be promoted to admins:
  ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/hgd-admin user-mkadmin <username>

Start the Server
----------------

Start hgd_netd and hgd_playd using the standard rc.d procedures:
  ${RCDIR}/hgd_netd start && ${RCDIR}/hgd_playd start

Check everything went OK:
  ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/hgd-admin status

Using the HGD Client
====================

You can (for example) queue a track like this:
  hgdc -u <username> q <some_media_file>

See the manual pages for more information.

Miscellaneous Notes
===================

* Both the client and server are configurable using a config file. See the
  example config files and manual pages for details.

* If you use aucat, remember that the _hgd user must have access to the aucat
  socket.
