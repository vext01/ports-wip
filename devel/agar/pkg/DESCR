Agar is a modern open-source, cross-platform toolkit for graphical
applications implemented in C, C++, Perl and Ada (with bindings to other
languages in development). Designed for ease of integration, it follows
the philosophy of building the GUI around the application, and not the
other way around. The Agar GUI library is designed to work under almost
any platform that provides a graphic display and input device. Beginning
with the 1.4 series, Agar can be built without any dependencies, and has
even been used on embedded devices without any operating system.
