+Upgrade From TeX Live 2009
+==========================
+
+Due to inconsistencies in the legacy TeX Live 2009 package, upgrades will
+complain about non-empty directories. This is harmless, but can be silenced by
+(having backed up anything manually added to texmfs) removing all
+TeX Live packages, then `rm -Rf /usr/local/share/texmf*`. Now you can
+install afresh the new TeX Live 2010 packages.
+
+Other Misc. Notes
+=================
+
+Gmverb
+------
+
 Note that gmverb is broken upstream. When I see a fix, it will be fixed.
 
+Tlmgr
+-----
+
 The 'tlmgr' script was disabled in the OpenBSD package. This is because
 updating TeX Live in this way will upset the package tools due to
 differing file checksums.
 
+Soft Dependencies
+-----------------
+
 Some requirements of TeX Live were not included as dependencies to make the
 package less bloated for people who don't need those features.
 
 As far as I know:
+
 * You should install ruby and ImageMagick if you wish to use ConTeXt.
   Don't forget to link your chosen ruby version to the default as detailed in
   the ruby package's installation message.
+
 * asymptote is in ports: graphics/asymptote
