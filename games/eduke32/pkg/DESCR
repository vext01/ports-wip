Source-port of the venerable Duke Nukem 3D, also usable as a homebrew
game engine. Besides increasing portability, the engine adds new
renderers, in-game configurability, console, plus extended editing and
scripting capabilities. Networking for dukematches and coop play is
fully functional. "EDuke32 makes sandwiches!"
