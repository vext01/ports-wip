=head1 NAME

tlpfiles - list files contained in a TeX Live package, or vice versa

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  tlpfiles [I<option>]... I<tlpkg>
  or: tlpfiles [I<option>]... -pkgof I<file>...

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-pkgof> I<file>...

Output the TeX Live package(s) in which each I<file> is contained.

=item B<-help>

Print this documentation and exit.

=back

The standard options B<-q>, B<-v>, and B<-logfile>=I<file> are also
accepted; see the C<process_logging_options> function in
L<TeXLive::TLUtils> for details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In the first form, with just I<TLPKG> specified, return all the files
contained in the given TeX Live package (as determined by reading the
TeX Live package database).  This includes any executables as well as
runtime, documentation, and source files.

It does not include the C<.tlpsrc> file for the package, since that is
necessarily part of the build infrastructure, and not part of the
self-contained package.

In the second form, with the C<-pkgof> option, return the TeX Live
package in which each given I<FILE> is contained, or C<-> if no package
can be found.  The files may be given as a single whitespace-separated
argument, or the C<-pkgof> option may be given more than once, or both.
Example invocation, given the list of files to search for in C</tmp/f>:

  tlpfiles --pkgof "`cat /tmp/f`"

Any directory part of the files is stripped.  If there are multiple
packages holding files by the same name, all are returned,
space-separated, followed by a tab, followed by the basename searched for.
