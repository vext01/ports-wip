Those strange 00texlive packages
================================

00texlive.config
----------------
contains configuration options about the tlnet archive and the distribution
itself.

Supported settings:
	container_split_src_files	$tlpdb->config_src_container
	container_split_doc_files	$tlpdb->config_doc_container
	container_format/xz		$tlpdb->config_container_format
	release/NNNN			$tlpdb->config_release
	revision/NNNNNN			$tlpdb->cofnig_revision

Used in install-tl and tlmgr to determine the "abilities" (split container)
and release of the remote tlpdb.

Origin of the fields is 
	%TeXLive::TLConfig::TLPDBConfigs
plus TLMedia->revision for the revision field.

The values are set by tlpkg/bin/tl-update-tlnet (and tlpsrc2tlpdb) in the
generated tlpdb from the default values as given in %TLPDBConfigs.


00texlive.installation
----------------------
(from the tlpsrc itself)
This package serves two purposes:

1. at installation time the present values are taken as default for
   the installer

2. on an installed system it serves as a configuration file.
   We have to remember these settings for additional package
   installation, removal, etc.

In the tlpsrc itself only those options are saved that are used *ONLY*
at installation time, currently opt_paper, opt_path, opt_frozen.
These will longdesc be saved in the local tlpdb and will not be
accessible by tlmgr.

All other options are set from TLConfig::TLPDBOptions to the
default values specified there.

There are two types here:
- If the key starts with opt_ this is an options that can be
  set by the user either at installation time or via tlmgr later on
- If the key starts with setting_ this value cannot be changed
  by the user directly with tlmgr, but only by other actions.
  Currently there are only two settings supported of which one
  is only used in special cases:
  . setting_available_architectures lists all available platforms
    and should be always present
  . setting_platform *overrides* the auto-deteced platform. This
    setting will only be present when you forced a sepcific 
    architecture with -force-arch to install-tl

The value of __MASTER__ for the location field tells the
installer to use the present directory itself.  For example,
the DVD can be mounted anywhere and we want the installer to work.

Access to the fields:
	$tlpdb->option("name"[, "val"]);
	$tlpdb->setting("name");

Currently supported:
	opt_location:__MASTER__
	opt_paper:a4
	opt_create_formats:1
	opt_desktop_integration:1
	opt_file_assocs:1
	opt_post_code:1
	opt_w32_multi_user:1
	opt_path:0
	opt_sys_bin:/usr/local/bin
	opt_sys_info:/usr/local/info
	opt_sys_man:/usr/local/man
	opt_install_docfiles:1
	opt_install_srcfiles:1
	opt_frozen:0

	setting_available_architectures:arch1 arch2 arch3 ...
	setting_platform:arch


Origin of the fields: 
For most of the fields it is %TeXLive::TLConfig::TLPDBOptions, and
for opt_paper, opt_path, and opt_frozen the 00texlive.installation.tlpsrc



00texlive.image
---------------
(from the tlpsrc itself)
This package collects some files which are not caught by any of the
other TL packages. Its purpose is to make the file coverage
check happy.  The files here are not copied by the installer
and containers are not built; they exist only in the
full DVD image or the installer archives.

The IgnorePatterns in the check_files routine in tlmgr.pl
augment this list.


00texlive.installer
-------------------
(from the tlpsrc itself)
This package defines the files to go into the installer
archives (install-tl-unx.tar.gz, install-tl.zip) built
by the tl-make-installer script.  Most of what's here is also
included in the texlive.infra package -- ordinarily duplicates
are not allowed, but in this case, 00texlive.installer is never
used *except* to build the installer archives, so it's ok.
