category Scheme
shortdesc minimal scheme (plain only)
longdesc This is the minimal TeX Live scheme, with support for only plain
longdesc TeX. (No LaTeX macros.)  LuaTeX is included because Lua scripts
longdesc are used in TeX Live infrastructure.  This scheme corresponds
longdesc exactly to collection-basic.
