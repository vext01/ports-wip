Installer/Updater/Layout
========================

layout
------

root directory ROOT (texlive2008 or texlive-2008 or ...)

	ROOT/texmf-dist
	ROOT/texmf
	ROOT/texmf-config
	ROOT/texmf-var
	ROOT/bin

	ROOT/tlpkg/texlive.tlpdb
	ROOT/tlpkg/tlpobj
	ROOT/tlpkg/ ...

As suggested by Reinhard, and discussed with Karl, I propose to put the
texlive.tlpdb NOT into ROOT, but "hide" it somehow, i.e., put it into
	ROOT/tlpkg


distribution methods
--------------------

  inst CD/DVD

    contains all the packages in zip (or lzma or ...) form, plus the
    installer and the texlive.tlpdb

  live DVD

    contains a live tree, no zip media, plus the texlive.tlpdb

  network

    zip files
    "package version" file
    texlive.tlpdb (??? necessary, could be ignored)


format of the zip files
----------------------
(can be another compression method)

The zip files contain the files with pathes relative to ROOT, i.e.,
	./texmf-dist/...
	./texmf/...
	./bin/...

Furthermore, the zip file contains a TLPOBJ file in
	./tlpkg/tlpobj/NAME.tlpobj

This allows the distribution of "packages" even from outside of TeX Live
(imagine that someone creates a minion-pro.zip for installation into
the TeX Live installation). 

OTOH this is a duplication in some cases since the inst and live media
the same information is present in the texlive.tlpdb. But I think that the
win of "self containment" over "no duplication" is more important.

Furthermore, Karl suggested that some people may want to recreate the
texlive.tlpdb in case it was destroyed. For this we have to ship the
tlpobj files.

  files in the zip 
  tlpobj data from shipped texlive.tlpdb or the zip file
