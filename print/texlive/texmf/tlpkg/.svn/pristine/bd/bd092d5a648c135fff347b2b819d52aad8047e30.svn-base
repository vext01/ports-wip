                  Imbedding files in a dvi file

                 written by SHIMA, November 1999


sample.dvi  contains some graphic files.  

1. To list the graphic files, execute

   > dviadd sample

   in the command (MS-DOS) Window.  To write the list in a file, execute

   > dviadd sample > file.txt

   dviout for Windows can list the files contained in the dvi file by 
   [Help -> Buffer Info].


2. To extract the graphic files from  sample.dvi, execute

   > dviadd e sample


3. To change  sample.dvi  which contains no graphic files, execute

   > dviadd d sample

   sample.dvi contains Japanese characters and the font data is embedded
   in the DVI file as a file  dviout.etf.  It is extracted in the above.

5. After making  file.txt  and extracting the graphic files, one can make
   sample.dvi  as follows.

   > platex sample
   > dviadd @file.txt sample

  Here the part after the file name of each line in  file.txt  is ignored.
