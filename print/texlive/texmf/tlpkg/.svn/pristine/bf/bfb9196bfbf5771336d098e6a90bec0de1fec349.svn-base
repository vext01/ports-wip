split-desktop-integration

I have implemented one additional installer option (and support in tlmgr)
that splits the current
        desktop_integration
which currently relates to both shortcuts on the desktop and in the menu
into two options:
        desktop_integration
        menu_integration
that do one thing.

Support is written for the installer (text, perltk, wizard), and tlmgr
(changing the settings).

Karl mentioned that both options should be here, but menu_integration
should *not* be visible for the user at installation time, and should
only be used by $portable.
