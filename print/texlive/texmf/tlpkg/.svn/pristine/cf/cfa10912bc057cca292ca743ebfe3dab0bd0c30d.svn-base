shortdesc Turkish hyphenation patterns.
longdesc Hyphenation patterns for Turkish in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings.
longdesc The patterns for Turkish were first produced for the Ottoman Texts
longdesc Project in 1987 and were suitable for both Modern Turkish and Ottoman
longdesc Turkish in Latin script, however the required character set didn't fit
longdesc into EC encoding, so support for Ottoman Turkish had to be dropped to
longdesc keep compatibility with 8-bit engines.
