	maybe you have only to master \SetTimer, \Pause and \Wait.
	
	\SetTimer
		set the timer with unit is milli-seconds.
		e.g., \SetTimer{2000} means internal timer is set to 2sec.
		Only if you use \Pause with strictly positive timer interval,
		\special{dviout `timer ...} will be embedded in every page.
		The default value is 0.
	\Pause
		Embed \special{pause}.
		More, \special{dviout `timer ...}, \special{dviout je}
		and \special{dviout jt} will also be embedded if you 
		specify positive timer interval by \SetTimer, or used
		`auto' option.
		Most appropriate specials will be automatically embedded
		by this macro package.
	\Wait
		wait milli-seconds specified as the argument.
		e.g., \Wait{10000} will wait 10sec.
	\GoNext
		go to next page immediately.
	\GoTop
