          necessary to handle PSfrag.
       2. Susie plug-in is required to include graphic files in various formats
          except for PS/EPS/PBM/BMP/WMF/EMF.
       3. Appropriate mktexpk, ps2pk, dvipsk and Ghostscript(gswin32c in PATH) 
          are necessary to use PostScript fonts
       4. gzip or gunzip is necessary for dviout to read gzipped files
       5. ABC output plug-in can be used for the output in the corresponding 
          graphic format
       6. dvipdfmx is necessary for the output of a rectangular region to a PDF
          file
