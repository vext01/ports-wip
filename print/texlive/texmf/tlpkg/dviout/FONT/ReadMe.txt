About FONTS directory

This directory contains two archives
1. winttf.zip
2. exjfonts.zip

1. winttf.zip
This is a package to use Windows' standard TrueType Fonts
including Japanese MS-P-Mincho/Gothic.
(called TSUMEGUMI)

2. exjfonts.zip
This contains Japanese extended packages.
For example,
  BURASAGE: hanging punctuation.
  LENS:     Chotai/Heitai.
  newmin:   a bug fixed and extended version of min10/goth10
  beta:     BETAGUMI Japanese fonts.

Both packages should be expanded at the root directory of TeX such as
c:\usr\local\share where the subdirectory texmf exists.
