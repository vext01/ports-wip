% This is the ttfonts.map file, describes a mapping
% between TeX Font Metric (TFM) files and Windows TrueType fonts.
% The writing form comes from DVIOUT, which is a DVI driver
% produced by SHIMA and others.
%
% In This file, I defined a mapping between *8r (what we call 8r-tfm) and
% Windows TrueType fonts. However, please don't use 8r-tfm file in your
% TeX documents (DVI file) but use 8t-tfm file.
% For example, please use wnsr8t.tfm but wnsr8r.tfm file.
% If you write `\font\timesnew=wnsr8t \timesnew' in your TeX source,
% TeX uses wnsr8t.tfm file. Then, in DVI file, there is a DVI command
% to use "wnsr8t" font. When DVIOUT searches the font, DVIOUT may
% find wnsr8t.tfm file. At the time, DVIOUT search in this ttfonts.map
% file for wnsr8t font, but in vain. DVIOUT next shall find wnsr8t.vf,
% the VIRTUAL font. In the wnsr8t.vf file, which is very similar with
% DVI file, in fact, there is a utility software written by Knuth to
% transform vf file to dvifile, named DVIcopy, there is a mapping
% from 8t-encoding to 8r-encoding.
% Now DVIOUT understands how to show the dvi file using wnsr8r fonts.
% Finally, DVIOUT searches wnsr8r font, which is defined in THIS FILE!
% Following the definition, DVIOUT shall request the Windows system
% to show the DVI file with using Times New Roman font!
%
% Set "ftt" parameter ([Option]-[Setup Parameters]-[Font2])
% like "c:\ptex\bin\ttfonts.map".
% 
% There is a trivial remark.
% You may use BaKoMa's TrueType fonts now.
% However, it is properly different from this.
% To use BaKoMa's font, DVIOUT only does "remapping".
% Of course you don't need to define the BaKoMa fonts in this file.
% This mechanism doesn't want to provide such a trivial way.
% It aims to use sophisticated TrueType fonts.
