shortdesc Latin hyphenation patterns.
longdesc Hyphenation patterns for Latin in T1/EC and UTF-8 encodings,
longdesc mainly in modern spelling (u when u is needed and v when v is needed),
longdesc medieval spelling with the ligatures \ae and \oe and the (uncial)
longdesc lowercase 'v' written as a 'u' is also supported.  Apparently
longdesc there is no conflict between the patterns of modern Latin and
longdesc those of medieval Latin.
