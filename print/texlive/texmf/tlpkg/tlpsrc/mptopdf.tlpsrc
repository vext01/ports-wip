shortdesc mpost to PDF, native MetaPost graphics inclusion

longdesc The mptopdf script does standalone conversion from mpost to
longdesc PDF, using the supp-* and syst-* files.  They also allow native
longdesc MetaPost graphics inclusion in LaTeX (via pdftex.def) and
longdesc ConTeXt.  They can be used independently of the rest of
longdesc ConTeXt, yet are maintained as part of it.  So in TeX Live we
longdesc pull them out to this separate package for the benefit of LaTeX
longdesc users who do not install the rest of ConTeXt.

longdesc This can be found on CTAN in macros/pdftex/graphics.

# more info:
# 
# supp-pdf is the main thing; it needs supp-mis for helper macros.
# 
# supp-mpe is for ConTeXt extensions (i.e., certain MetaPost specials),
# according to pdftex.def (it is loaded by
# \LoadMetaPostSpecialExtensions).
# 
# mptopdf is for turning MetaPost files into stand-alone PDF.
# mptopdf.pl relies on a format created from mptopdf.tex, which in turn
# reads all the above *.mkii files.
